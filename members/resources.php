											************************************************************************************</p>
										<p>(NICHE NAME) is the popular keyword phrase that buyers and info seekers search for when they have (something about the niche) There are many websites and services on the net that effectively sell material on this subject and it can be an amazing opportunity for minimal advertising costs and lower competition, but with great conversions and there is still an amazing demand for this type of information.</p>

											LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NAMES:<br />
											************************************************************************************</p>
										<p>Ok so it is more than evident that there are multiple qualities regarding these domains.</p>
										<p>Keyword Domains: First off, buyers of (NICHE NAME) actually search many of these terms off the bat, and you will have the .COM so doing some simple SEO or hiring a company that gets paid only when you rank can be a total success. Populate the site with some information regarding (NICHE NAME) and then Monetize with some simple affiliate links and Voila!

										<p>Hybrids: These are brandables OR keyword domains. My personal favorite as you will get the best of both worlds. People are basically already searching for your brand-name! It's usually a catch phrase and whoever has the domain is the obvious authority in the niche. These domains sell like hotcakes so you can be sure to be able to resell them down the road as well.</p>
